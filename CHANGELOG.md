# 📋 Changelog

All notable changes to Gameball Android SDK are documented here

## [3.2.1] - 2026-07-09 🔧

> **Patch Release**: Widget header no longer sits under the status bar / display cutout

### 🐛 Fixed
- 📱 **Widget Top Buttons Tappable**: the widget content is now padded by the status-bar / display-cutout height, so the header and close buttons are no longer drawn underneath the system bar and stay tappable (seen on Pixel and Android 15)
- 🎨 **Status-Bar Icon Contrast**: `GameballWidgetActivity` uses a dedicated `Theme.GameballWidget` with dark status-bar icons, keeping them visible over the widget's white top band

## [3.2.0] - 2026-06-17 📱

> **Minor Release**: Widget event channel, widget dismissal controls, external-link handling, diagnostic logging, and channel-merging parameters

### ✨ Added
- 🏗️ **Widget Event Channel**: `ShowProfileRequest.widgetEventCallback` receives events posted from the widget (e.g. game completion) as a `Map<String, Object>` `{type, metadata}`; the `gameCompleted` payload carries `hasWon`, `rewardType`, `discountType`, `rewardName`, `campaignId`, `campaignType`
- 🏗️ **Web-Initiated Close**: the widget can dismiss its own webview via `window.GameballWidget.closeWidget()`
- 🏗️ **Host-Initiated Dismiss**: new `GameballApp.hideProfile()` dismisses the widget programmatically (no-op when nothing is shown)
- ⚙️ **External-Link Handling**: links flagged `gbExternalBrowser=true` open in the system browser; optional `externalLinkCallback` lets the host intercept them
- 📊 **Diagnostic Logging**: added internal diagnostic logging to aid SDK troubleshooting
- 📇 **Channel-Merging Parameters**: `ShowProfileRequest.builder()` now accepts optional `mobile` and `email` to support customer channel merging

### 🔄 Changed
- 🔧 **User-Agent Header**: unified the `x-gb-agent` header format to `GB/<sdkType>/<version>`


## [3.1.2] - 2025-12-15 🔧

> **Patch Release**: Widget URL fix

### 🐛 Fixed
- 🔧 **Widget URL**: eliminated a null `customerId` value from the widget URL

## [3.1.1] - 2025-12-15 🔧

> **Patch Release**: Guest mode support for profile widget

### 🐛 Fixed
- 🎁 **Guest Mode Support**: Profile widget can now be displayed without customer authentication
- 🔓 **Optional Customer ID**: `ShowProfileRequest.customerId` is now optional, defaulting to `null` for guest mode

### 🔄 Changed
- 🏗️ **ShowProfileRequest Builder**: No longer requires customer ID - supports guest mode scenarios
- 📝 **Widget URL Construction**: Enhanced to support both authenticated and guest modes

### 🛠️ Developer Experience
- ⚡ **Simpler API**: Build `ShowProfileRequest` without customer ID for guest mode
- 🎯 **Flexible Usage**: Support for preview/showcase scenarios before user registration
- 📖 **Better Documentation**: Clear examples for both guest and authenticated modes

## [3.1.0] - 2025-10-14 🔒

> **Security Release**: Token-based authentication with per-request override support

### 🔒 Security
- 🛡️ Added Session Token authentication mechanism for secure API communication
- 🔐 Optional `sessionToken` parameter in `GameballConfig` for global token-based authentication
- 🎯 Per-request session token override support for flexible authentication control
- 🔄 Automatic secure endpoint routing (API v4.0 → v4.1) when session token is provided
- 📡 `X-GB-TOKEN` header added to requests when using session token authentication

### ✨ Added
- 🎯 Optional `sessionToken` parameter added to `initializeCustomer()` method
- 🎯 Optional `sessionToken` parameter added to `sendEvent()` method
- 🎯 Optional `sessionToken` parameter added to `showProfile()` method
- 🔄 Per-request token override allows temporary authentication changes without affecting global state
- ♻️ Passing `null` as sessionToken clears the token for that specific request

### 🔧 Internal Changes
- 💾 Added SharedPreferences support for secure token storage and management
- 🏷️ Standardized internal widget parameters (`playerid` → `customerId`)
- 📊 Added API version constants (`API_V4_0`, `API_V4_1`) for version management
- 🎨 Added `@JvmOverloads` annotation for backward compatibility with existing code
