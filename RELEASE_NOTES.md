## 🚀 Key Features

### Centralized Configuration
```kotlin
val config = GameballConfig.builder()
    .apiKey("your-api-key")
    .lang("en")
    .platform("android")
    .shop("your-shop-id")
    .build()

GameballApp.getInstance(this).init(config)
```

### Customer Initialization with Builder Pattern
```kotlin
val customerRequest = InitializeCustomerRequest.builder()
    .customerId("customer-123")
    .email("customer@example.com")
    .mobileNumber("+1234567890")
    .deviceToken("fcm-device-token")
    .pushProvider(PushProvider.FCM)
    .customerAttributes(attributes)
    .build()
```

### Enhanced Event Tracking
```kotlin
val event = Event.builder()
    .customerId("customer-123")
    .eventName("purchase")
    .eventMetaData("product_id", "12345")
    .eventMetaData("amount", 99.99)
    .build()
```

### Flexible Customer Attributes
```kotlin
val attributes = CustomerAttributes.builder()
    .displayName("John Doe")
    .firstName("John")
    .lastName("Doe")
    .addCustomAttribute("tier", "premium")
    .addAdditionalAttribute("source", "mobile")
    .build()
```
